Welcome to my calorie tracker project, this project was created for me to understand and develop my skills in django, html and api's. This website has over 100,000 food nutritional information to chose from. 
To run this project python will need to be installed and also the following: 

First activate the virtual environment using the following (windows, cmd):
venv\Scripts\activate

install Django within virtual environment using:
pip install Django

also install:
pip install requests
pip install django-mathfilters

to run the project use the following:
python manage.py runserver

if you are unable to run the project here are a few images of my project.

the api used is from api ninjas.

unfortuantly due to changes made to api ninjas, this project has some issues which i will fix once i have finished my other projects. recently api ninjas has put some nutrional information such as calories, protein and serving size behind a pay wall, this change to the api has cause said nutrional informaion to not show up which has also affected the pie chart within the website and the 'to burn off x calories' section. whilst this can be fixed buy paying to unlock the paywall this is not within my financial budget as a university student, so i will have to find another api to use.
